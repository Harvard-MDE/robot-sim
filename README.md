# robot-sim
A Python project to implement a very basic arena, aiming to simulate multi-robotics system without dealing with the completed ROS system setup and to demonstrate simulation easily cross-platform, powered by Pygame. 

Features including: 
- Testing reference algorithms without ROS setup
- Plotting various objects to represent different testing environment
- Support animation about robots behavior
- Support scaling for multi-robots
- Support path recording
- Flexible to be modified: i.e. dealing with mouse inputs, real-time updating etc.
